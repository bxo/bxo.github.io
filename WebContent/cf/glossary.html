<td>Application Programming Interface</td>

<tr>
<td>BOSH</td>
<td>BOSH is an open framework for managing the full development and deployment life cycle of large-scale distributed software applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CLI</td>
<td>Command Line Interface</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DEA</td>
<td>Droplet Execution Agent. The DEA is the component in PWS responsible for staging and hosting applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Domains</td>
<td>A domain is a domain name like <code>cfapps.io</code>. Domains can also be multi-level and contain sub-domains like the “myapp” in <code>myapp.cfapps.io</code>. Domain objects belong to an org and are not directly bound to apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Droplet</td>
<td>An archive within PWS that contains the application ready to run on a DEA. A droplet is the result of the application staging process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Management</td>
<td>You can manage spaces and orgs with the cf command line interface, the Cloud Controller API, and the Cloud Foundry Eclipse Plugin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ops Manager or Operations Manager</td>
<td>Operations Manager is a web application that you use to deploy and manage a Pivotal CF PaaS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org</td>
<td>An org is the top-most meta object within the PWS infrastructure. Only an account with administrative privileges on a PWS instance can manage its orgs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Routes</td>
<td>A route, based on a domain with an optional host as a prefix, may be associated with one or more applications. For example, <code>myapp</code> is the host and <code>cfapps.io</code> is the domain when using the route <code>myapp.cfapps.io</code>. It is possible to have a route that represents <code>cfapps.io</code> without a host. Routes are children of domains and are directly bound to apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service</td>
<td>A “factory” which produces service instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Instance</td>
<td>A reserved resource provisioned by a service. The resource provisioned will differ by service; could be a database or an account on a multi-tenant application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spaces</td>
<td>An org can contain multiple spaces. You can map a domain to multiple spaces, but you can map a route to only one space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Staging</td>
<td>The process in PWS by which the raw bits of an application are transformed into a droplet that is ready to execute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warden</td>
<td>The mechanism for containerization on DEAs that ensures applications running on PWS have a fair share of computing resources and cannot access either the system code or other applications running on the DEA.</td>
</tr>
