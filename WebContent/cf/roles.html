        <p>Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control (RBAC), with each role granting
permissions in either an org or a space.</p>

<h2><a id="orgs"></a>Orgs</h2>

<p>An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators can own and use. All collaborators access an org with user accounts. Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services availability, and
custom domains.</p>

<h2><a id="spaces"></a>Spaces</h2>

<p>Every application and service is scoped to a space.
Each org contains at least one space.
A space provides a set of users access to a shared location for application
development, deployment, and maintenance.
Each space role applies only to a particular space.</p>

<h2><a id="roles"></a>Roles and Permissions</h2>

<p>A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the user’s overall permissions in the org
and within specific spaces in that org.</p>
