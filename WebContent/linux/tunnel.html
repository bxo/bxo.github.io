    <pre>
    	<code>
ssh -L localport:host:hostport user@ssh_server -N 

where: 
-L - port forwarding parameters (see below) 
localport - local port (chose a port that is not in use by other service) 
host - server that has the port (hostport) that you want to forward 
hostport - remote port 
-N - do not execute a remote command, (you will not have the shell, see below) 
user - user that have ssh access to the ssh server (computer) 
ssh_server - the ssh server that will be used for forwarding/tunneling 
	</code>
	</pre>
	
		<p class="view">
	Without the -N option you will have not only the forwardig port but also the remote
 shell. Try with and without it to see the difference.

    	<code>
Note: 
1. Privileged ports (localport lower then 1024) can only be forwarded by root. 
2. In the ssh line you can use multiple -L like in the example... 
3. Of course, you must have ssh user access on secure_computer and moreover 
   the secure computer must have access to host:hostport 
4. Some ssh servers do not allow port forwarding (tunneling). See the sshd man 
   pages for more about port forwarding (the AllowTcpForwarding keyword is set to 
   NO in sshd_config file, by default is set to YES)...
